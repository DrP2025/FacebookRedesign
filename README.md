Redesign project using HTML5, CSS3, and JQuery

The main page is 'index.html' and will be the only page for this redesign. To get this redesign to completely work, please download the folder font-awesome-4.7.0 from http://fontawesome.io/assets/font-awesome-4.7.0.zip. 

One of my goals was to use Psuedo elements and fool around with some current web technology. This project is just for fun.
